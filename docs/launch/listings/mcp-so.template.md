# mcp.so — listing refresh copy
> **Rendered from `.claims.json` by `npm run llms:render`; `llms:check` fails if this file and its template disagree.** Edit `docs/launch/listings/mcp-so.template.md`, never this file. Every number is a slot. Never write "first", "best", "leading" or "standard"; never say Iris captures or scores anything "automatically" — under MCP a tool call is the model's decision, and the two capture paths that do not depend on it (`POST /api/v1/traces`, the `iris-eval-capture` plugin) are named as such. The paste is the listing owner's act.


**Listing:** https://mcp.so/servers/mcp-server-iris-eval (the older `/server/iris/iris-eval` address redirects here). mcp.so ingests from the Official MCP Registry (`server.json`), so a registry publish refreshes the description within about two days; edit by hand only when the listing is still stale after that, and only as the listing's claimed owner (ownership is claimed by email to the directory's support address from the maintainer's address).

## Two claims faults to remove wherever they still show

1. Any sentence beginning "The first …" — a superlative retired from all copy.
2. Any rule count other than **{{ruleCount}}** and any tool count other than **{{mcpToolCount}}**.

## Description field

{{tagline}}. Iris is an open-source MCP server that scores every agent run for quality, safety, and cost. {{mcpToolCount}} tools your MCP client lists on connect — no SDK, no code changes. {{ruleCount}} built-in rules ({{piiPatterns}} PII patterns, {{injectionPatterns}} prompt-injection patterns, {{hallucinationMarkers}} hallucination signals, cost thresholds, and {{trajectoryRuleCount}} that read the agent's tool calls) score deterministically and free; a detected PII leak, injection or blocklist hit fails the verdict whatever the score says, and every verdict names the layer that decided it. Optional LLM judge ({{llmJudgeTemplateCount}} templates, your own key, a hard per-call cost cap) and citation verification for the semantic questions. {{dataResidency}} MIT-licensed core.

## Install snippet

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iris-eval": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["{{npmPackage}}", "--dashboard"]
    }
  }
}
```

## The check before you save

The listing must say **v{{version}}**, **{{mcpToolCount}} tools**, **{{ruleCount}} rules**, and the identifier **`iris-eval`** (the config key, the plugin and the command are all `iris-eval`; `iris` and `iris-mcp` are retired names). If any field on the form still shows an older number or the word "first", replace it — a live listing is not historical content.
