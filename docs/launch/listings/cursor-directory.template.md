# cursor.directory — listing refresh copy
> **Rendered from `.claims.json` by `npm run llms:render`; `llms:check` fails if this file and its template disagree.** Edit `docs/launch/listings/cursor-directory.template.md`, never this file. Every number is a slot. Never write "first", "best", "leading" or "standard"; never say Iris captures or scores anything "automatically" — under MCP a tool call is the model's decision, and the two capture paths that do not depend on it (`POST /api/v1/traces`, the `iris-eval-capture` plugin) are named as such. The paste is the listing owner's act.


**Listing:** https://cursor.directory/plugins/iris. **The slug is the one identity the freeze cannot reach:** the product's identifier is `iris-eval` on every surface we own (config key, plugin, skill, command), and the listing still carries the bare `iris`. Ask the listing to rename the slug to `iris-eval` when editing; until it does, the description and the config block below carry the right name.

## Description field

{{tagline}}. Iris is an open-source MCP server that scores every agent run for quality, safety, and cost. {{mcpToolCount}} tools your MCP client lists on connect — no SDK, no code changes. {{ruleCount}} built-in rules ({{piiPatterns}} PII patterns, {{injectionPatterns}} prompt-injection patterns, {{hallucinationMarkers}} hallucination signals, cost thresholds, and {{trajectoryRuleCount}} that read the agent's tool calls) score deterministically and free; a detected PII leak, injection or blocklist hit fails the verdict whatever the score says, and every verdict names the layer that decided it. Optional LLM judge ({{llmJudgeTemplateCount}} templates, your own key, a hard per-call cost cap) and citation verification for the semantic questions. {{dataResidency}} MIT-licensed core.

## Config block (the form's MCP JSON field)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iris-eval": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["{{npmPackage}}", "--dashboard"]
    }
  }
}
```

## The check before you save

The listing must say **v{{version}}**, **{{mcpToolCount}} tools**, **{{ruleCount}} rules**, and the identifier **`iris-eval`** (the config key, the plugin and the command are all `iris-eval`; `iris` and `iris-mcp` are retired names). If any field on the form still shows an older number or the word "first", replace it — a live listing is not historical content.
